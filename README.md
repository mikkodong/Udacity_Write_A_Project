## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>


For this project, I want to know what do programmers look for in job opportunities and what do they look for or not expecting in candidates if they were recruiters
With StackOverflow Survey data, I'm interested in answers to these two questions:
 
  'When you're assessing potential jobs to apply to, how important are each of the following to you?' 
  'How important should each of the following be in Globex's hiring process?'


1. what do programmers look for in job opportunities 
2. If programmers were recruiters, what do they look for in potential candidates
3. What is deemed as not important to recruiters so candidates can have less focus on when preparing for job interviews




The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
